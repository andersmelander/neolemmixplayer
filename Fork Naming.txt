These are my requests to anyone who is creating a fork of NeoLemmix, in terms
of how these forks should be named.

Firstly, please note that these are just that - requests. These are not legally
binding, nor will they be enforced through moderation on any Lemmings website
where I am in control of such decisions (and I discourage any other Lemmings
websites from doing so, either). The only "enforcement" that should occur is
through community acceptance or lack thereof; and in particular, where the
community feels that a decision that goes against these requests is nonetheless
in the best interest of NeoLemmix culture, I encourage the community to accept
such forks. Please do take into account that in saying this, I specifically
consider the "focus on the puzzle, not the execution" aspect of NeoLemmix as
a core aspect of its culture, and a shift away from this may mean it's time
for a new engine with a new name even if it's based on NL under the hood.

** This has been written with the assumption V12.14.0 will be the final version.
   Should this not hold true, replace all references to it with the actual final
   version. **


Any fork should not contain "NeoLemmix" in its name UNLESS it is fully compatible
with content made for NeoLemmix V12.14.0. "Fully compatible" means that a level file
and a corresponding replay will have the same outcome on this fork that it would
have on NeoLemmix V12.14.0. In the case of the official styles (ie: default, xmas,
special, orig_XXXX and ohno_XXXX), this outcome must hold true using the copies
of styles provided with/for the respective engines (ie: "the replay has the same
result if you use NL 12.14.0's styles instead of my fork's copies" doesn't count).
To avoid doubt, this does not mean the fork cannot also support additional content
that NL V12.14.0 does not support; as long as the fork does support all content
that NL V12.14.0 does.

The exception is if the fork in question, instead targets such compatibility with
an older NeoLemmix version. In this case, the fork name should not begin with
"NeoLemmix", but may contain it (eg: avoid "NeoLemmix Gimmick Edition", but you
could use "Gimmicky NeoLemmix").

Any fork also should not contain "NeoLemmix" in its name if it does not keep the
general spirit of NeoLemmix in regards to UI features. This doesn't mean it has
to preserve every UI feature as-is, but it should be developed in line with NL's
philosophy that difficulty should come from figuring out a level's solution, not
from executing it.

This also extends to any name designed to closely resemble "NeoLemmix", such as
"Neo Lemmix", "NooLemmix", "N30L3mm1x", etc.

To avoid any doubt, such forks are still permitted to be made; I just ask that you
call them something else.
